# Introduction
Picture this: you live in a remote village in Afghanistan, and the nearest school is 3 kilometers away. (*And no, you canâ€™t catch a bus to school, because... well, who needs public transport in the mountains?*) What do you do?

Well, in Afghanistan, the Community-Based Education (CBE) program comes to the rescue! ðŸŽ“

CBE is like a secret weapon, bringing education to children in the most far-flung corners of the country. 

These "classrooms" aren't your typical school buildings. Nope, theyâ€™re held in **homes, mosques, tents, or even community spaces**â€”because learning should happen everywhere, right? (*And by the way, thereâ€™s no WiFiâ€”just good old-fashioned human connection and a little bit of imagination.*)

In this notebook, weâ€™ll dive into a dataset that shows us how this incredible initiative worksâ€”right from how many boys and girls are enrolled, to the types of classrooms (*spoiler: theyâ€™re pretty creative*). 

Letâ€™s explore how this education revolution is happening on the groundâ€”no classrooms needed, just heart and community!


# Dataset Overview

This dataset contains information about Afghanistan's Community-Based Education (CBE) facilities, collected by UNICEF. It includes key details about each CBE, such as:

- **Class Type**: CBS (Community-Based Schools) and ALC (Accelerated Learning Centers). No fancy schools here, just classrooms made with love and a whole lot of creativity.
- **Enrollment**: Weâ€™ll see how many boys and girls are part of the action. Spoiler: the girls are making waves! ðŸ’ª
- **Infrastructure**: Classrooms could be in homes, mosques, tents, or community spaces. It's like a pop-up school festival, but with more textbooks and fewer food trucks. 
- **Language of Instruction**: Itâ€™s mostly Dari and Pashto, the heart and soul of Afghan education.

The data covers 10 provinces in Afghanistan, including:
- Parwan
- Badakhshan
- Urozgan
- Panjsher
- Kunduz
- Zabul
- Jawzjan
- Hirat
- Sar-e-Pul
- Samangan

With these insights, we can start uncovering how these classrooms are shaping education in rural Afghanistan. Time to roll up our sleeves!
